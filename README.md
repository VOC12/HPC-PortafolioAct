# Portfolio of Evidence - High Performance Python

## Overview

This notebook is a comprehensive Portfolio of Evidence for High Performance Python practices. I designed it to demonstrate proficiency in optimizing Python code for better performance and efficiency. The notebook is structured into several key sections, each focusing on different aspects of performance optimization in Python.

## Sections

### A) Benchmarking and Profiling
- **Julia Set:** An exploration of Julia Set computations as a case study for performance benchmarking.
- **Timing Decorator:** Implementing decorators to measure execution time of functions.
- **Measurements:** Discussing various measurement strategies for assessing code performance.
- **cProfile:** Utilizing cProfile for detailed profiling of Python programs.
- **Snakeviz cProfile Statistics:** Visualizing cProfile statistics with Snakeviz for a more intuitive understanding of profiling data.
- **Line_profiler and kernprof:** Advanced profiling with line-by-line analysis to identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory_profiler:** Investigating memory usage and identifying opportunities for optimization.

### B) Lists and Tuples
- A comparison of lists and tuples in Python, with a focus on performance implications.

### C) Dictionaries and Sets
- Understanding the performance characteristics of dictionaries and sets and their efficient use.

### D) Matrix and Vector Computations
- Techniques for efficient matrix and vector computations in Python, crucial for numerical and scientific applications.

### E) Compiling to C
- An introduction to converting Python code to C for significant performance gains, leveraging Cython and other tools.

## How to Use

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a Python environment with necessary packages installed (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, memory_profiler, Cython).
- **Running the Notebook:** Open the notebook in Jupyter or another compatible IDE, and execute the cells sequentially to observe the performance optimizations in action.
- **Customization:** Feel free to modify the examples or add new sections to explore other high-performance Python techniques.
